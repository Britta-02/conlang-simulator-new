        <h1>Welcome to your conlang creator</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the site that helps you create a realistic lexis for your own conlang.</p>

        <br><br>
        <h2>Why use this site?</h2>
        <p class = "info-text">When making a natural conlang (constructed language), simulating the changes and history of a language can really help to make it more realistic. One aspect in which this can be helpful, is creating the lexis (all the words of a language). That is because languages evolve. Words that were used a thousand years ago go through many sound changes in which sounds can be changed or merged with another, or sounds can be dropped. These changes can occur for different reasons, like ease of pronunciation, culture or influence from other language. To create a realistic lexis, you can create these type of changes, fitting your language and it’s history. Then you should create words as they were used in your proto-language (a language from a long time ago, from which other languages have evolved). By applying all changes you created to these words, you get realistic, modern words. However, to actually go through all these rules without making any mistakes can take a long time. That is why I created this website. You only need to fill in your rules and the proto-words (the old words) and click on ‘create new words’. You will immediately get the modern words for your language, saving many hours of work. </p>
